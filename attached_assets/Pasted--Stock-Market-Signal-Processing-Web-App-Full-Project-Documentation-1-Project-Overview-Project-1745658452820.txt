📚 Stock Market Signal Processing Web App: Full Project Documentation
1. 📜 Project Overview
Project Title:

Stock Market Signal Processing and Decision Support Web App

Short Summary:
This web application analyzes historical stock market data using signal processing techniques, particularly Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), to detect hidden cycles.
It then generates intelligent Buy / Hold / Sell recommendations based on the detected patterns, and offers interactive visualizations and forecasts.
The app is aimed at learners, traders, researchers, and financial enthusiasts.

2. 🧩 Project Description
The app bridges the gap between complex signal processing and accessible financial decision making.

It allows users to:

Upload stock price data (or fetch live data via ticker symbol),

Analyze periodic behaviors using Fourier Transform,

Visualize both the time-domain (price history) and frequency-domain (cycle strength),

Get real-time trading advice (buy/hold/sell) based on detected market cycles,

Download reports summarizing findings and visualizations.

It solves the problem of making technical market cycle detection usable and actionable for non-technical users.

6. 🔥 Workflow Summary
User uploads CSV file or enters stock ticker symbol.

Data is preprocessed (cleaned, detrended).

FFT is computed → detect frequency patterns.

Dominant cycles are identified.

Decision Engine suggests Buy / Hold / Sell based on cycles.

Results and plots are displayed interactively.

User can download a full report summarizing the findings.

7. 📈 Potential Future Improvements

Future Upgrade	Description
Machine Learning Forecasts	Train models (like LSTM) on cyclical data for advanced forecasting
Portfolio Analysis	Allow analysis of multiple stocks at once
Cycle Pattern Clustering	Group similar cyclical behaviors across stocks
Live Signal Notifications	Send alerts to user when cycle signals trigger (email or SMS)
Advanced Filtering	Allow users to filter by sector, volatility, cycle strength
AI-Based Decision Engine	Move from rule-based to a learned trading strategy
8. 👨‍💻 Example Use Case Scenario
User: Doreen uploads AAPL_prices.csv (Apple stock prices for 3 years).
App:

Cleans and preps the data,

Detects a strong 22-day cycle,

Advises Buy (next low expected in 4 days),

Shows time series with cycle overlays,

Provides option to download a PDF report with all analysis and graphs.
